                <p>I am professional landscaper.I have 5 Year experiance.What happens in Landscapers
                        The landscape is convicted of the double murder and sentenced to 25 years in prison. In the end, Chris writes a letter to Susan, pretending to be Gerard seeDev. This indicates how he might have known all along that she wrote the letters, and he decides to keep the fantasy alive by sending a similar letter to Susan.Are Landscapers funny.
                            Landscapers not only benefits from great performances by Colman and Thewlis, but it's a dark comedy that's actually howlingly funny in between all of the darkness. That balance is very difficult to achieve.</p>
